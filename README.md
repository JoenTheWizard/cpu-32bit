# Verilog projects

Just some small verilog projects I made for learning

Right now I have:
- NOR-based SR (Set/Reset) Latch: A sequential circuit with two cross coupled NOR gates used for memory circuits to store values
- Four-bit adder: A full adder that adds two 4 bit values
- 4x1 Multiplexer: A 4 to 1 multiplexer, a combinational circuit, that selects from one of four input signals
